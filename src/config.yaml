    - text: It's a spaceship. Brilliant! I got a spaceship on my first go.
      user: MICKEY
    - text: It looks kind of abandoned. Anyone on board?
      user: ROSE
    - text: Nah, nothing here. Well, nothing dangerous. Well, not that dangerous. You
        know what, I'll just have a quick scan, in case there's anything dangerous.
      user: DOCTOR
    - text: So, what's the date? How far we gone?
      user: ROSE
    - text: About three thousand years into your future, give or take.
      user: DOCTOR
    - text: 51st century. Diagmar Cluster, you're a long way from home, Mickey. Two and
        a half galaxies.
      user: DOCTOR
    - text: Mickey Smith, meet the universe. See anything you like?
      user: ROSE
    - text: It's so realistic!
      user: MICKEY
    - text: Dear me, had some cowboys in here. Got a ton of repair work going on. Now
        that's odd. Look at that. All the warp engines are going. Full capacity. There's
        enough power running through this ship to punch a hole in the universe, but we're
        not moving. So where's all that power going?
      user: DOCTOR
    - text: Where'd all the crew go?
      user: ROSE
    - text: Good question. No life readings on board.
      user: DOCTOR
    - text: Well, we're in deep space. They didn't just nip out for a quick fag.
      user: ROSE
    - text: No, I've checked all the smoking pods. Can you smell that?
      user: DOCTOR
    - text: Yeah, someone's cooking.
      user: ROSE
    - text: Sunday roast, definitely.
      user: MICKEY

      user: CLARA
    - text: Hello.
      user: DOCTOR
    - text: You're young again. You're okay. You didn't even change your face.
      user: CLARA
    - text: Ha! It's started. I can't stop it now. This is just the reset. A whole new
        regeneration cycle. Ooo.
      user: DOCTOR
    - text: Taking a bit longer. Just breaking it in. Oh. Oh. Gah.
      user: DOCTOR
    - text: It all just disappears, doesn't it? Everything you are, gone in a moment,
        like breath on a mirror. Any moment now, he's a-coming.
      user: DOCTOR
    - text: Who's coming?
      user: CLARA
    - text: The Doctor.
      user: DOCTOR
    - text: But you, you are the Doctor.
      user: CLARA
    - text: Yep, and I always will be.
      user: DOCTOR
    - text: But times change, and so must I.
      user: DOCTOR
    - text: Amelia?
      user: DOCTOR
    - text: Who's Amelia?
      user: CLARA
    - text: The first face this face saw. We all change, when you think about it. We're
        all different people all through our lives. And that's okay, that's good, you've
        got to keep moving, so long as you remember all the people that you used to be.
        I will not forget one line of this. Not one day. I swear. I will always remember
        when the Doctor was me.
      user: DOCTOR
    - text: Raggedy man. Good night.
      user: AMY
    - text: No, no.
      user: CLARA
    - text: Hey.
      user: DOCTOR
    - text: Please don't change.
      user: CLARA
    - text: Kidneys! I've got new kidneys. I don't like the colour.
      user: DOCTOR
    - text: Of your kidneys?
      user: CLARA
    - text: What's happening?
      user: CLARA
    - text: We're probably crashing. Oh!
      user: DOCTOR
    - text: Into what?
      user: CLARA
    - text: Stay calm. Just one question. Do you happen to know how to fly this thing?
      user: DOCTOR

    - text: We'll blast them into dust, then fuse the dust into glass, then shatter them
        all over again.

      user: DOCTOR
    - text: Just stop the bombardment. That's all I'm asking. I'll do anything you want,
        just, just stop.
      user: DOCTOR
    - text: Say please.
      user: BAINES
    - text: Please.
      user: DOCTOR
    - text: Wait a minute. (sniff) Still human.
      user: JENNY
    - text: Now I can't, I can't pretend to understand, not for a second, but I want you
        to know I'm innocent in all this. He made me John Smith. It's not like I had any
        control over it.
      user: DOCTOR
    - text: He didn't just make himself human. He made himself an idiot.
      user: JENNY
    - text: Same thing, isn't it?
      user: BAINES
    - text: I don't care about this Doctor and your family. I just want you to go. So
        I've made my choice. You can have him. Just take it, please! Take him away.
      user: DOCTOR
    - text: At last.
      user: BAINES
    - text: Don't think that saved your life.
      user: BAINES
    - text: Family of Mine, now we shall have the lives of a Time Lord.
      user: BAINES
    - text: It's empty!
      user: BAINES
    - text: Where's it gone?
      user: DOCTOR
    - text: You tell me.
      user: BAINES
    - text: Oh, I think the explanation might be you've been fooled by a simple olfactory
        misdirection. Little bit like ventriloquism of the nose. It's an elementary trick
        in certain parts of the galaxy. But it has got to be said, I don't like the looks
        of that hydroconometer. It seems to be indicating you've got energy feedback all
        the way through the retrostabilisers feeding back into the primary heat converters.
        Oh. Because if there's one thing you shouldn't have done, you shouldn't have let
        me press all those buttons. But, in fairness, I will give you one word of advice.
        Run.
      user: DOCTOR
    - text: Get out! Get out!
